This section discusses the implementation of personalized AI recommendations for each user. We utilized OpenAI's pre-trained RNN transformers and tailored them to our project's needs. The provided script outlines how we fine-tuned our OpenAI model to provide personalized recommendations categorized as Good, Bad, and Moderate. This involved feeding custom data from 2021 to the OpenAI models along with personalized ratings. Subsequently, an OpenAI instance was created for our custom needs.

In conclusion, we designed a system where sending a user a health profile quiz prompts the OpenAI model to return a rating of Good, Bad, or Moderate based on the user's responses.
